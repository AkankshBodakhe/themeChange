                <h1>Tesseract</h1>
                <p>A <b>tesseract</b> also known as a <b>hypercube</b>, is a four-dimensional geometric shape that
                    serves as the 4D analog of a cube. Just as a cube is an extension of a square into the third
                    dimension, a tesseract extends a cube into the fourth spatial dimension, which is beyond the three
                    dimensions we experience in everyday life. Structurally, a tesseract consists of 8 cubical cells, 16
                    vertices, 32 edges, and 24 square faces, with each edge of equal length. Since humans cannot
                    directly visualize four-dimensional objects, tesseracts are often represented as 3D projections or
                    2D diagrams, commonly depicted as two cubes connected at their vertices.</p>

                <p>The tesseract holds significant importance in various fields. In mathematics, it is studied in
                    higher-dimensional geometry and topology, helping to explore the properties of spaces with more than
                    three dimensions. In physics, it plays a role in theories involving additional spatial dimensions,
                    such as string theory and advanced cosmological models. Computer science uses tesseracts in data
                    visualization and graphical representations of multi-dimensional data. Additionally, the tesseract
                    has gained prominence in popular culture, often symbolizing advanced technology or
                    higher-dimensional concepts, such as its depiction in the movie <b>Interstellar</b> and its role as
                    a powerful artifact in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While the tesseract may appear as a "cube
                    within a cube" in projections, this is simply a visual analogy for its 4D nature rather than an
                    actual containment of cubes.</p>
